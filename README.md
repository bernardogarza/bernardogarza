### Hi there 👋

My name is [Bernardo Garza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-g-landa/) and I am a Web developer with a keen interest in learning new technologies and perfecting my current skills. I am passionate about design, good looking UI, and functional UX.

I have experience working remotely and pair programming. I have developed several web apps that can be used by companies by implementing their branding.

Check out [My Portfolio](https://bernardogarza.me) (work in progress :hourglass_flowing_sand:)

I'm looking for a fully remote position or relocating to California, the south of Canada or, Europe.



```js
const bernardo  = {
  code: [Html, Css, Ruby, Javascript],
  tools: [Rails, React, Redux, Sass],
}
```



- 🌱 I'm currently learning TensorFlow.js, Spring.js, D3.js and Three.js
- 🤔 I'm interested in learning GatsbyJS and Next.js
