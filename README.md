### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Bernardo Garza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-g-landa/) and I am a Web developer with a keen interest in learning new technologies and perfecting my current skills. I am passionate about design, good looking UI, and functional UX.

I have experience working remotely and pair programming. I have developed several web apps that can be used by companies by implementing their branding.

Check out [My Portfolio](https://bernardogarza.me) (work in progress :hourglass_flowing_sand:)

I'm looking for a fully remote position or relocating to the south of Canada or Europe.
