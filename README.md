### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Bernardo Garza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-g-landa/) and web developer with a strong
interest in learning new front end
technologies and perfecting my
current skills. I am interested in
teams valuing quality, and clean
code principles.

I have experience working remotely and pair programming. I have developed several web apps that can be used by companies by implementing their branding.
